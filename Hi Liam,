Hi Liam,

Thanks for your answers.

Everything makes sense, however this situation raises some concerns over the search functionality.

Search
These are the mapped fields which search depends on. If the fields is empty the job won't get filtered on that criteria resulting an inaccurate results.
Job title -> JobTitle
Job type -> JobType
Location -> County
Sectors -> Sector
Salary -> Currently uses field From (However, this only works when the job salary period is set to Year.)

Those fields were available in the example XML files that Voyager send us, whole I can see some information in your job description, but not as actual attributes.

Is it not possible to always have these attributes




Thanks,

Paulius
